# East-End Coffee Shop
A feature-rich, full-stack website for a coffee shop that allows users to browse products, place orders, and make payments seamlessly. The project includes a responsive frontend built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

Additionally, an AI-driven chatbot was developed using Python, PyTorch, and NLTK, enabling users to place orders and resolve inquiries through natural language interactions. The chatbot integrates with the backend via a Flask-based API, employing advanced NLP techniques and neural networks to classify user intents, extract order details, and map them to the product database efficiently.

This project combines intuitive user experience, efficient backend systems, and cutting-edge AI to enhance customer interaction and streamline the ordering process.
